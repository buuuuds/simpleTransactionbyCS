# Apple Purchase Calculator (C# Console App)

This is a simple C# console program that calculates the total cost of buying apples, accepts user cash input, and returns the change. If the entered cash is insufficient, the program keeps prompting until a valid amount is entered.

## ðŸ’» How It Works

1. User inputs the number of apple pieces.
2. User inputs the value of each piece.
3. Program calculates the total amount.
4. User is prompted to enter their cash.
5. If the cash is **less than the total**, the program will keep asking for a valid amount.
6. Once enough cash is entered, the change is displayed with **2 decimal places**.
